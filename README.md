# synonyma

"synonyma" is Greek for synonyms.

This is a customized polynomial homotopy continuation implementation for computing small crystal structures from idealized diffraction intensities. 

The C++ code was used for the paper and the Python version is meant to be a concise version for readability and testing new ideas.
